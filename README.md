This is a presentation about Celtic mythology in the iron age. The Celtic religion was like most other iron age religions polytheist. Polytheism is the belief that multiple gods exist. Other examples of polytheistic mythologies are the greek and norse mythologies. The reason that the Celtic mythology is not as popular as the abovementioned mythologies is that it isn´t as well preserved. Celtic mythology has only been preserved by a couple of sources due to the fact that all stories were always orally preserved from generation to generation. Most of the big sources come from christian monks. There are some big gaps in the mythology but it is still really interesting. The Celts lived all across Europe, from Portugal to Turkey, but I am mainly going to focus on the Celts from Ireland. The Celtic-Irish mythology is divided into four so called cycles, each containing different mythological stories. The four cycles are: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle and the Historical Cycle. I am probably going to butcher all the names because i am sadly not a fluent speaker of old irish. The Mythological Cycle has stories about the former gods and the origins of the Irish people, it is the least well preserved of the bunch. The Ulster Cycles has stories about the Ulster province in northern Ireland. The stories in this cycle are set around the first century CE and are mostly about the king of Ulster, Conchobar mac Nessa and the great hero Cú Chulainn. The Fenian Cycle has stories about Fionn mac Cumhaill and his band of soldiers. The stories are set in the 3rd century and take place in provinces Leinster and Munster in the east and south of Ireland. The Historical Cycle is a record of different real kings throughout Irish history mixed with mythological stories and fictitious kings into different poems. I am now going to tell you about the some of the deities in the irish mythology. The deities i am going to tell you about are Dagda and Morrigan. Dagda is commonly referred to as “the good god” and he is the god of wisdom, magic, agriculture, manliness, strength and fertility. I would just want to mention that a lot of the deities powers are overlapping. Dagda has a large club which can both kill and resurrect humans, two pigs, a cauldron full of a endless supply of food and a harp used to change seasons. Morrigan is often called the “phantom queen”, she is the god of fate and war. It is believed that she sometimes turns herself into a raven and flies over the battlefield during war. She can predict the outcome of a battle and she often landed on warriors to signal their incoming death. I sadly do not have enough time to go into detail about any of the mythological stories but i hope you found my presentation interesting anyways. Thanks for listening
